    <p> I am a Research Assistant in Health Economics with a strong interdisciplinary background in engineering, data science, and applied economic research. I hold a BTech in Electrical Engineering and an MTech in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science from IIT Bombay.</p>
    <p> My research interests lie at the intersection of health economics, development economics, and mental health. I am particularly interested in understanding how socio-economic factors shape mental health outcomes, cognitive functioning, and well-being in low- and middle-income country contexts, with a focus on India. Methodologically, I work with large-scale survey and administrative data, applying econometric and data-driven approaches to study health and social policy questions. </p>
    
    <p>Before transitioning fully into economics research, I received rigorous training in quantitative methods, programming, and statistical analysis, which continues to inform my research approach. My current work involves applied research projects in health and development economics, and I plan to pursue a fully funded PhD in Economics or Public Policy.</p>

    <p>Beyond research, I am deeply interested in ideas from psychology, philosophy, and the social sciences that help explain how individuals and societies function. This website documents my academic work, ongoing projects, and related intellectual interests.</p>
