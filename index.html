    <p> Welcome to my website!</p>
    <p> Here you can find my profile, academic endeavours, projects, and extra-curricular interests. I am a recent graduate from IIT Bombay pursuing Data Science, and most of my projects include Python programming. Writing a piece of code and seeing it work makes my day :)</p>

    <p>If you are interested, do check out the Reading section where I have compiled book recommendations and reviews.</p>
    
    <p> Cheers!</p>

<div id="about-me" style="display: none;">

  <p>I am 23 years of age. My hometown is Mumbai. I have completed a Dual Degree at <b>IIT Bombay</b>: B.Tech in <b>Electrical Engineering</b> and M.Tech in <b>Artificial Intelligence and Data Science</b>. </p>
  <p>I am a budding Data Scientist and ML engineer. Developing intelligent systems for automation and building end-to-end pipelines for their seamless working interests me quite a lot. My key area of expertise is <b>Python</b> programming for system development, data processing and ML. I have completed multiple projects in Python over the last 4 years.</p>
  <p> For my masters thesis, I worked in the field of Music Information Retrieval on a task aimed at finding correspondence between mutiple modalities in Hindustani classical music performances. Through the same I managed to publish a paper at International Society of Music Information Retrival (ISMIR), 2023 in Milan, Italy and a related Journal paper in TISMIR 2024.
  <p>I am currently working at NoBroker Technologies Solutions Pvt Ltd. as an Associate Data Scientist, in Bengaluru. The job involves work with LLMs, ASR systems, audio and text data processing and Python development.</p>

  <h3>My Technical Interests</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Python development</li>
    <li>Machine Learning, Deep Learning</li>
    <li>Speech and audio processing, Music Computing</li>
    <li>Natural Language Processing</li>
    <li>Data analytics, statistics</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>My Non-Technical academic interests</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Economics (especially behavioral economics)</li>
    <li>Psychology (especially managerial psychology, mental health)</li>
    <li>Philosophy (especially on what it means to live a good life)</li>
    <li>Evolutionary Biology (and its implications in daily life)</li>
    <li>Any other stuff that is intellectually stimulating</li>
  </ul>
  I have completed several courses in Humanities and Social Sciences at IIT Bombay as a part of "Additional Learning" and I hold a keen interest in this domain. I believe that knowledge of humanities is non-negotiable if we want to make the world a better place. We need more and more individuals who are skilled in both technology and humanities if we want to make life better in the 21st century.
